*A human with a piece of paper is, in some sense, much smarter than a human without. A human with mathematical notation can solve problems they otherwise couldn’t. Access to computers makes us capable of incredible feats that would otherwise be far beyond us.*

When we teach computers to write, the computers don’t replace us any more than pianos replace pianists—in a certain way, they become our pens, and we become more than writers. We become writers of writers.
- Generate captions for images, then poems for the captions [demo](https://vimeo.com/158403097)
- Model trained on the Oxford dictionary to generate plausible definitions for made up words i.e. love as “past tense of leave,”

[Part II](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/adventures-in-narrated-reality-part-ii-dc585af054cb) Explore its application to generate a short film script, including musi [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=409&v=LY7x2Ihqjmc). The lack of objective meaning in the generated script pushed the bounderies of the creative process "The actors and production team’s interpretations and realizations of the computer’s descriptions was a fascinating case of human-machine collaboration"
"We typically consider the job of imbuing words with meaning to be that of the writer. However, when confronted with text that lacks objective meaning, the reader assumes that role. In a certain way, **the reader becomes the writer**."
- Autocomplete for lyricists could turn writing song lyrics into a conversational process, with a writing partner made of metal and electricity, perhaps fine tuned with bias toward the topics and references that its human collaborator prefers.
