# Skinny Bones Jekyll Starter

Just a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. I like to think of it as a starter for building your own Jekyll site. I purposely keep the styling minimal and bare to make it easier to add your own flare and markup. To learn more about how to use the theme and install it check out the [Skinny Bones demo](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) (*work in progress*).
